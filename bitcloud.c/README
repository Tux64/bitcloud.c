Requirements
============

Current requirements:

- GCC and GNU make.
- sqlite3-dev
- xxd
- pkg-config

Tested on Debian 7, Does not compile on Mac OSX 10.9.

Compile instructions
====================

To compile, just:

# make


Nodepool
========

To generate the nodepool, run:

# ./bitcloud

Every time that nodepool.sql is modified, the last nodepool is deleted, so
make backup copies in case that the content in the actual nodepool is
important to preserve.

The generated nodepool can be open by sqlite3 or a client of it:

# sqlite3 nodepool
>  .schema
>  .help

To see the logs from the command line:

# sqlite3 nodepool "select * from logs"

TESTS
=====

# make tests

This will create a nodepool on "tests" directory and run tests.

CLEAN
=====

# make clean

This will remove all compiled files, the nodepool, and tests.
